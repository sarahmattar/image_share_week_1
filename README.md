# image_share

This is the week 1 code of `image_share` for Coursera's [Intro to Meteor.js](https://www.coursera.org/learn/meteor-development?specialization=website-development)
course.

### How do I get this on my computer?

If you're new to GitHub, you may be asking this. The answer is you clone it! (Or you can download the `.zip` file.)

Go to the top right corner and click on the green "Code" button. From there, you can
download a .zip file, or, if you're familiar with Github, you can clone it using
the HTTPS or SSH link. (Ignore the Github CLI option.)

Copy the URL link from the text box below. In the Command Line (Terminal),
navigate to the Desktop (or wherever you store your Meteor projects), type
`git clone` and paste the URL. That will download the repo into a folder called
`image_share_week_1`.

### Then what do I do?

Just like when you download the source code from Coursera, you have to install
`node_modules`.

To do this, run `meteor npm install --save @babel/runtime`.
